# Student Comments from Block 1 (Week 2)

### WHICH ASPECTS OF THE TRAINING DID YOU FIND THE MOST HELPFUL DURING THIS WEEK?

- Ryan pulling double duty and his level of care
- Lectures have been fun (ish)
- Breaking things down visually and relating to daily real stuff
- Focus on being adventurous and exploratory

### WHICH ASPECTS OF THE TRAINING DID YOU FIND THE LEAST HELPFUL DURING THIS WEEK?

- Open-Endedness
- The madness of it all
- Feels a little bit scattered. When will it come "together"
- Flying by some of the basics (like TDD)
- The break comes with a price
- Some last minute changes
- Kinks with the classroom and video
- Still not enough TAs available

### DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, SUGGESTIONS, OR CONCERNS?

- More Code Review!
- More TA Prep Time ... so they're better setup to help
